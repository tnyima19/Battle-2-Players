#Battle between 2 players. 
##First phase 
This is A very basic game where two players battle.
-Players can attack.
-Players can defend.
-Defense halves the damage of your opponent for next turn. 
Your health is determined by number. 
Both players will have 100 health inthe beginning.

##2nd phase 
The game now has multiple levels
After you defeat the first enemy. 
You go to the second level where the boss heath doubled. 
if you defeat him you go to level 3. 


This project was built using core concepts from Inheritance and Polymorphism. 

------------------PLANS FOR FUTURE
Turn base combat.(DONE)
Improvements I am planning to make.(DONE )
Health bar for both players.(DONE)
ABILITY TO INCREASE DEFENSE.(DONE)

Improvements I am planning to make.
When someone increases their defense, the oppnent's chances of landing an attack decreases. 
Health bar for both players.


I am also planning to automate one of the players so that the player fights against the computer instead of another human.I will be using random patters, for the computer, so that computer is not predictable on what it is going to do(attack or defend).

I am also planning to create two more levels where the computer gains more health and its power increases if you beat it.
