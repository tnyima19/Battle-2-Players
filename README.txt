This is A very basic game where two players battle. 
You can either choose to defend or attack. 
Defense halves the damage of your opponent for next turn. 
Your health is determined by number. 
Both players will have 100 health inthe beginning.

This project was built using core concepts from Inheritance and Polymorphism. 

Improvements I am planning to make.
When someone increases their defense, the oppnent's chances of landing an attack decreases. 
Health bar for both players.
