#Battle between 2 players. 
##First phase 
This is A very basic game where two players battle.
-Players can attack.
-Players can defend.
-Defense halves the damage of your opponent for next turn. 
Your health is determined by number. 
Both players will have 100 health inthe beginning.

##2nd phase 
The game now has multiple levels
After you defeat the first enemy. 
You go to the second level where the boss heath doubled. 
if you defeat him you go to level 3. 


This project was built using core concepts from Inheritance and Polymorphism. 

------------------PLANS FOR FUTURE

Improvements I am planning to make.
When someone increases their defense, the oppnent's chances of landing an attack decreases. 
-add agility to the game, agility increases the probability to dodge. 
-RPG elements like levels, once you defeat enemy you gain exp. 

I am also planning to automate one of the players so that the player fights against the computer instead of another human.
