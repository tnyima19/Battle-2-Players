This is A very basic game where two players battle. 
You can either choose to defend or attack. 
Defense halves the damage of your opponent for next turn. 
Your health is determined by number. 
Both players will have 100 health inthe beginning.

This project was built using core concepts from Inheritance and Polymorphism. 
I didn't use pointers as I didnt' need them, and teachers also advised us not to use pointers during our projects, because they sometimes may cause crash if they are not used correct.

------------------PLANS FOR FUTURE

Improvements I am planning to make.
When someone increases their defense, the oppnent's chances of landing an attack decreases. 
Health bar for both players.


I am also planning to automate one of the players so that the player fights against the computer instead of another human.I will be using random patters, for the computer, so that computer is not predictable on what it is going to do(attack or defend).

I am also planning to create two more levels where the computer gains more health and its power increases if you beat it.
